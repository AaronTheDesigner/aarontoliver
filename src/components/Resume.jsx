                        <p>An imaginative web developer and a graduate of UNCC's Coding Bootcamp seeking full time employment. As a dedicated coder and a lifetime learner, I am educated in several front-end and back-end languages and technologies. These include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, SQL, Node, Express, and Git. My strongest language is JavaScript, and my favorite libraries are React, Redux, and Axios, with an emerging interest in GraphQL and Socket.io. Due to my career history in customer service, I have extensive communication and leadership skills.</p>
